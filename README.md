Shooter
=======

SpriteKit mini-game in swift (converted from Objective-C) with a Christmas theme

I first wrote 'Shooter' in November 2013 as a gag for Christmas, because I was interested 
to do something with SpriteKit. After Swift was announced I was looking through my grab bag
of toy projects for something suitable to try and convert to Swift.

'Shooter' was a good candidate, because it's not too big but also not too trivial. The commit
history is probably a good account for the process. The only major stumbling block was that
the emitter node archives simply would not load in Swift. Therefore I ended up recreating the 
flame and the smoke in code.
